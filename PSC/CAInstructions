1) Create the directories to hold the CA certificate and related files:
sudo mkdir CA
sudo mkdir CA/certs
sudo mkdir CA/private
sudo mkdir usr/certs
sudo mkdir usr/csr
sudo mkdir usr/private

2) The CA needs a few additional files to operate, one to keep track of the last serial number used by the CA, each certificate must have a unique serial number, and another file to record which certificates have been issued:

sudo sh -c "echo '01' > CA/serial"
sudo touch CA/index.txt
sudo cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf openssl.cnf

3) The third file is a CA configuration file. Though not strictly necessary, it is very convenient when issuing multiple certificates. Edit ssl/openssl.cnf, and change:

[ CA_default ]
dir             = ./                 # Where everything is kept
database        = $dir/CA/index.txt     # database index file.
new_certs_dir   = $dir/usr/certs        # default place for new certs.
certificate     = $dir/CA/certs/ca.cert # The CA certificate
serial          = $dir/CA/serial        # The current serial number
private_key     = $dir/CA/private/ca.key# The private key
default_days    = 3650                  # how long to certify for
default_bits    = 4096

[ req_distinguished_name ]              
countryName                     = Country Name (2 letter code)
countryName_default             = US
countryName_min                 = 2
countryName_max                 = 2
stateOrProvinceName             = State or Province Name (full name)
stateOrProvinceName_default     = Washington DC
localityName                    = Locality Name (eg, city)
localityName_default            = Georgetown
0.organizationName              = Organization Name (eg, company)
0.organizationName_default      = Georgetown University
1.organizationName              = Second Organization Name (eg, company)
1.organizationName_default      = Computer Science Department
organizationalUnitName          = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
organizationalUnitName_default  = Differential Tor Project
commonName                      = Common Name (eg, YOUR name)
commonName_max                  = 64
emailAddress                    = Email Address
emailAddress_max                = 40

4) Generate the root CA key: (<passphrase: Root>)

sudo openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 4096

5) Create the insecure key, the one without a passphrase, and shuffle the key names:

openssl rsa -in ca.key -out ca.key.insecure
sudo mv ca.key.insecure ca.key

6) Next, create the self-signed root certificate:

sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.cert -config openssl.cnf

7) Now install the root certificate and key:

sudo mv ca.key /etc/CA/private/
sudo mv ca.cert /etc/CA/certs/

8) Next create a user key and a certificate signing request in one step: (<passphrase: Client1>)

sudo openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout DC1.key -out DC1.csr -config openssl.cnf -days 3650

9) Create the insecure key, the one without a passphrase, and shuffle the key names:

openssl rsa -in DC1.key -out DC1.key.insecure
sudo mv DC1.key.insecure DC1.key

10) Using the CSR, generate a certificate signed by the CA:

sudo openssl ca -in DC1.csr -config openssl.cnf

11) There should now be a new file, usr/certs/01.pem, containing the same output. Rename it:

sudo mv usr/certs/01.pem usr/certs/DC1.cert

12) Now install the user certificate and key:

sudo mv DC1.csr usr/csr/
sudo mv DC1.key usr/private/
